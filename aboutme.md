# subtitle: research within a theory of change.

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italics">Power is the key to change; action builds power; science informs action.</p>


Carl Sagan said “science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of skeptically analyzing the universe.” I am interested in developing the scientific basis of a progressive vision for a democratic, equitable, and zero-emissions world. I hope to support social and political mobilization by engaging in an analytic and participatory process that builds on diverse epistemologies and sources of information to develop solutions that address to the challenges of our changing climate.

## Academic journey
I recieved my Ph.D. in July of 2024 in atmospheric science from the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences from the University at Albany under the advisement of Dr. Mathias Vuille. My dissertation focused on the isotopic hydroclimate of the South American Summer Monsoon. Through this work I synthesized diverse data sources to study the past, present, and future of large-scale atmospheric variability and change. In addition to leading a few research projects, I was thrilled to work with colleagues from across the Americas to advance collaborative research goals as part of the <a href="https://www.pirecreate.com" target="_blank">PIRE-CREATE program</a>.

<p>Prior to my graduate education, I recieved my B.S. in Environmental Science with a focus in climate science from the University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities.</p>

## Personal notes
In my personal time, I can be found in nature on a hike, in my garden, or tending houseplants. I also enjoy being active through camping, cooking, dancing, rock climbing, and hiking. I love traveling and have lived in abroad in Argentina and Germany.

Mentoring and teaching one-on-one to support people on their personal and professional paths is important to me. If you would like to have a conversation, please <a href="mailto:rgorrison@gmail.com">reach out</a>!

If you want to learn more about paleoclimate science (and hear what I sound like), watch the amazing documentary *Chasing Traces* that I narrated.
