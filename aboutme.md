## Academic journey
I recieved my Ph.D. in July of 2024 in atmospheric science from the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences from the University at Albany under the advisement of Dr. Mathias Vuille. My dissertation focused on the isotopic hydroclimate of the South American Summer Monsoon. Through this work I synthesized diverse data sources to study the past, present, and future of large-scale atmospheric variability and change.

<p>Prior to my graduate education, I recieved my B.S. in Environmental Science with a focus in climate science from the University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities.</p>

## Adventures in dreamland
Beyond my academic life, I have had the privilege of pursuing my passions around the globe.
- I have lived in South America and Europe
- I love dancing, hiking, rock climbing, baking, gardening
- I love mentoring and teaching one-on-one: please reach out!
  
### A little tidbit:

If you want to know what I sound like and learn more about paleoclimate science, watch the amazing documentary [Chasing Traces]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29](https://youtu.be/xztoAxSBpuo?si=omPashRVpjpvAo3M)).
