## Abstract 
Anthropogenic emissions are driving a weakening and expansion of the tropical circulation in the zonal mean state, though this zonal averaging masks regional variability. Ultimately, it is critically important to understand the regional perspective in order to assess the local hydroclimate impacts of such changes. In South American, the regional overturning circulation comprises the principle dynamic structure of the summertime monsoon circulation. The influences of circulation changes on the monsoon hydrologic variability are best traced by oxygen isotopes in precipitation and water vapor, which integrate phase changes from evaporation in the tropical Atlantic to rainout across the monsoon domain, into the tropical Andes, and as far south as southeastern Brazil and northern Argentina. Yet to what extent the changes in circulation are reflected by &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> and &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>v</sub> changes has not yet been tested. Novel isotope-enabled simulations extending to the end of the 21st century illustrate the enrichment of heavy isotopes in precipitation and tropical drying that accompanies weakening of the regional overturning circulation. This work confirms that projected future trends of Hadley circulation weakening and expansion also apply on a regional scale over South America. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the capacity of utilizing oxygen isotope ratios as a proxy for atmospheric circulation in the past to reconstruct historic regional Hadley circulation variability. 

## Key interpretations
Haldey circulation change in South America during the austral summer, corresponding to the South American Summer Monsoon mature season, is measured by a poleward expansion of the subsidence zone in an isotope-enabled global climate model ensemble simulation (CESM1.2 model coupled to CAM6).
