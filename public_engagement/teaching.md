My public education has instilled in me the value of education for the public good. As an educator, my primary goal is not merely to transfer knowledge, but to empower others to be actively engaged in their learning and connect educational content to their day-to-day experience.

I have served as an educator in a variety of settings, including during workshops developed during my graduate education, a mentor to my peers and junior graduate students in my program, and as a guest lecturer and teaching assistant for accredited courses.
