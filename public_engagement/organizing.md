### Public Power 
The [Public Power NY Coalition ](https://publicpowerny.org/) is a statewide movement of community and advocacy organizations fighting for an environmentally sustainable energy system thatâ€™s also racially, socially, and economically just. We believe energy and a habitable planet are human rights.

We are building a popular campaign to fight for a focused on a campaign to take public ownership and control over all aspects of our energy system and back from for-profit monopolies. Our coalition has developed two pieces of [legislation](https://www.publicpowerny.org/legislation/) to win public power for New York State, the New York Build Public Renewables Act and the New York Utility Democracy Act. 

I was actively involved in leading the statewide overall strategy and labor relations strategy as a member of the Capital District chapter of DSA, a member organization of the Public Power NY Coalition. In this work, I trained a team of organizers, planned statewide rallies, and supported member organization engagement in the statewide coalition.

### Science for the People
The ['People's Green New Deal' Campaign](https://scienceforthepeople.org/peoples-green-new-deal/) was designed to call attention to the need to combat the climate crisis with widespread democratic input. We planned a series of [virtual teach-ins](https://scienceforthepeople.org/peoples-green-new-deal-virtual-teach-ins/), published a [Science for the People Magazine issue](https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/volume-23-number-2-a-peoples-green-new-deal/).
