### Public Power 
The [Public Power NY (PPNY) Coalition](https://publicpowerny.org/) is a statewide movement of community and advocacy organizations fighting for an environmentally sustainable energy system thatâ€™s also racially, socially, and economically just. PPNY believes energy and a habitable planet are human rights.

The coalition is building a popular campaign to develop publicly owned and controlled energy production infrastructure. The coalition successfully passed the New York Build Public Renewables Act in 2023 and continues to work for the implementation of a democratic energy landscape. 

Learn more about the coalitions ongoing work [here](https://publicpowerny.org/).

### Science for the People
The ['People's Green New Deal' Campaign](https://scienceforthepeople.org/peoples-green-new-deal/) was designed to call attention to the need to combat the climate crisis with widespread democratic input. We planned a series of [virtual teach-ins](https://scienceforthepeople.org/peoples-green-new-deal-virtual-teach-ins/), published a [Science for the People Magazine issue](https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/volume-23-number-2-a-peoples-green-new-deal/).

### Food and Climate Justice
This workshop was organized as a multi-part event comprising a Q&A with a panel of experts, small group discussions, and change for small groups to share back to the full audience. Over 80 people attended the event, sharing practices of community resiliency and brainstorming ideas for the future.
