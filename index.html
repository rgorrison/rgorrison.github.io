<p>I am a solutions-oriented climate scientist excited to integrate my experience as a researcher and community organizer with my passion for science and justice. Through my work, I have developed a record of both peer-reviewed <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Iy7JmM8AAAAJ"> publications and presentations</a> and <a href="rgorrison.github.io/outreach">community service and outreach</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, I am looking for research opportunities to help our society adapt to climate change and mititage the impact of continuing atmospheric pollution in order to build a positive vision for the future centered on justice and equity.</p>
<!-- <p>Currently, I am looking for research opportunities to help support the climate advocacy movement in building a positive vision for the future centered on justice and equity.</p> -->
